Requirements: `python`, `apt`

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/enjoythecode/dot.git
./dot/sh/link.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
# Words
My setup. Efficiency of keystrokes (less friction) and portability (low high-tail friction)
are priorities.

use `sh/link.sh` to create links for the necessary `.*rc` files. 

see `bash/.bashrc` for a list of aliases.
