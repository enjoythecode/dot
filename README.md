# Quick Start
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/enjoythecode/dot.git
./dot/sh/link.sh
source ~/.bashrc

# hack away; e(dit), l(s), c(lear) (c)d,...
```

Note that dot assumes that it is in the path `~/dot`

# Dependencies

Run `health/health.sh` (should be aliased to `h`)

You'll want to make sure that you have a "patched font", I use "Droid Sans Mono Nerd Font". see [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), [installation instructions](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## OS X only
`brew install coreutils` is required for gdate replacement to date

# Resources

use `sh/link.sh` to create links for the necessary `.*rc` files.

see `bash/aliases_and_functions.bashrc` for a list of aliases.

# Words
My setup. Efficiency of keystrokes (less friction) and portability (low high-tail friction)
are priorities.
