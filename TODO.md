TODO for the various files (and by extension, by personal computing config).

# Bash/Terminal
- `r`; read README if exists
- script to point out out-of-place files (S/ToSort, Trash, ~/\*...)
	- run on login?
- prompt.bashrc; display environment

# Editor/Nvim

- LSP
	- Actually get this to working
	- Small self-help manual to help me to get it working for new systems/langs
- testing setup?
	- use quickfix properly?
- tags, ltags, ctags... (understand them and see how I could use them)
- Telescope: yank the current item (rather than opening it)
